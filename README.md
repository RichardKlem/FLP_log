# Useful thoughts
 - Associative - the permutations in the row can be grouped together: ex. (RB')L = R(B'L)
 - Neutral element - there is a permutation which doesn't rearrange the set: ex. RR'
 - Inverse element - every permutation has an inverse permutation: ex. R - R'
 - Commutative - it's not a necessary condition of the permutation group but notice that FB = BF but FR != RF
 - Degree of permutations - see above. ex: 4 x F = 1, 6 x (R'D'RD) = 1, 336 x (UUR'LLDDB'R'U'B'R'U'B'R'U) = 1
